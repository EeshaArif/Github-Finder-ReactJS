	ReactJS:
reacts to state change and updates the DOM
// It just renders the view and makes sure the view is in sync with the state

Every Component:
class <classname>{
       state = {}; // data you want to display when the component is rendered
       render() {  // What the component should look like
      

   } // Output: React Element (A JS object that maps a DOM object) 
// It keeps a light weight representation of DOM (A virtual DOM)

// when you change the state of a component, you get a new react element (object)
}
